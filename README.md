## All Posts

The page displays a comprehensive collection of posts contributed by all users. The implementation utilizes Django Paginator, the Waypoints library, and the Infinity shortcut script from it to enable infinite scrolling. Within the post div, usernames and user profile pictures are hyperlinked to their respective user pages. If a post belongs to the currently logged-in user, a kebab menu will be presented, offering options to edit or delete the post.
